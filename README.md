# 🎁 Perfect Gift Finder

An AI-powered gift recommendation tool that helps you find thoughtful, personalized gifts for anyone in your life.

## What It Does

Finding the perfect gift is hard. You know the person, you know your budget, but somehow you still end up panic-buying a candle the day before their birthday. This tool fixes that.

Just answer a few questions about:
- Who the gift is for
- Their personality and interests
- The occasion
- Your budget
- What gifts you've given before (so you don't repeat)

And the AI will generate 5 personalized gift recommendations ranked from best match to good alternatives, plus a "wild card" option for something unexpected.

## How It Works

This app uses Claude (Anthropic's AI) to analyze your inputs and generate gift ideas that actually make sense for the specific person you're shopping for. It's not just pulling from a generic gift database—it reasons through what would genuinely delight your recipient based on everything you've shared.

## Built With

- **Streamlit** - Web app framework

## About

Created by Alexandra for Professor Hindman's AI Revolution course at The George Washington University (Fall 2025).

This project explores how large language models can automate and improve the gift-finding process—a task that's universally relatable, frequently performed, and can make everyday life a little easier.
